Programming elements: Hierarchical Clustering    
1. Clustering representations and dendrogram using Single, complete, and average link proximity function in hierarchical clustering technique.  

2. Taking Credit Card transactions dataset, 
Preprocessing the data by removing missing values.  
Applying StandardScaler() and Normalize() functions to scale and normalize raw input data.  
Using Principal Component Analysis reduced the input dimensions to 2 features.  
Applying Agglomerative Clustering with k=2,3,4 and 5 on reduced features and visualize result for each k value using scatter plot.  
Evaluated different variations using Silhouette Scores and Visualize results with a bar chart.
